Hello, my name is Audrey Peres. I am a second year MA student in the Economic's department. I am interested in programming in a data analytics capacity and hope to use it in the future for research. I have experience in State and R, and a cursory knowledge of Python. I have used pandas in my Research Assistant work, but am hoping to have a better understanding of coding and python by the end of this class.
